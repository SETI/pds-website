                VOYAGER 2 PPS RING OCCULTATION ARCHIVE
                --------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

This volume contains the data from the four Voyager 2 Photopolarimeter
(PPS) ring occultation experiments: delta Sco at Saturn, sigma Sgr at
Uranus, beta Per at Uranus, and sigma Sgr at Neptune. The data from
each experiment is provided in a variety of formats ranging from raw
to calibrated and resampled. Also provided are ancillary files
containing geometry, calibration models, and trajectory data, plus
software tools for manipulating the data.

For more detailed information and guidance about how to work with this
data set, see the file <a href="tutorial.html">DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT</a>. Most users will find the
calibrated, uniformly-sampled ring profiles in the EASYDATA directory
tree sufficient for their needs. Users wishing to dig further into the
details of the PPS experiment will probably need only consult the
EDITDATA, GEOMETRY and CALIB directories. Most other files in this
archive are provided primarily for documentation purposes and for
users with very special needs.

This data set represents the first component of a data set collection
which will also include the Voyager Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) and
Radio Science (RSS) ring occultation data sets.

Supporting documentation and label files conform to the Planetary Data
System (PDS) Standards, Version 3.5, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
document JPL D-7669 (October 15, 2002).

2. VOLUME FORMAT

This disk has been formatted according to the ISO 9660 Level 1
Interchange Standard. This format is compatible with a large variety
of computer systems (e.g. Sun, DEC, Macintosh, PC). For further
information, refer to the ISO 9660 Standard Document, RF# ISO
9660-1988, 15 April 1988.

3. FILE FORMATS

3.1 FILE EXTENSIONS

    Other files (for documentation only)        *.FDS, *.LOG, *.OUT

3.2 PDS LABELS

Every file in this data set is described by an associated PDS label.
Most files are described by a detached label, which has the same name
as the corresponding file but an extension ".LBL". Text files (*.TXT,
*.CAT) have attached labels.

In some cases, all or most of the files in a given directory share a
single, abbreviated "combined-detached" label. In this case, the name
of the file is the name of the enclosing directory, with extension
".LBL".

See the PDS Standards Reference (JPL D-7669) for a complete
description of the PDS label format. This document can also be found
online at
        //pds.jpl.nasa.gov/stdref/

3.3 ASCII TEXT FILES

Different popular operating systems use different standards for how
ASCII text files are formatted. On Unix systems, lines are terminated
by a &lt;LF&gt; (linefeed character, control-J, ASCII 10). On Macintosh
computers, lines are terminated by a &lt;CR&gt; (carriage return character,
control-M, ASCII 13). On PCs, lines are terminated by a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; pair.
PDS standards require all text files to use &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; line termination.
If the PDS label indicates INTERCHANGE_FORMAT = ASCII or RECORD_TYPE =
STREAM, then this line termination is in use.

On occasion, users on Unix and Macintosh computers may need to change
the line termination on some text files before they can use them. This
can be handled via text editors or a variety of utilities. For
example, the Unix tr (translate) command can be used to change
carriage returns to blanks:
    tr "\015" " " &lt;oldfile.txt &gt;newfile.txt

Some ASCII tables indicate RECORD_TYPE = FIXED_LENGTH and include an
additional parameter RECORD_BYTES, which indicates the length in bytes
of each record in the file. It should be noted that all ASCII files
still include the &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; line terminators, and these two bytes are
included in the byte count. For this reason, it is unwise to convert
the line terminator to a single character (&lt;LF&gt; on Unix or &lt;CR&gt; on
Macintosh) because this can change the number of bytes per record and
invalidate the label. In these situations, it is recommended that the
line terminator be replaced by a space plus &lt;LF&gt; or a space plus &lt;CR&gt;
instead.

3.4 BINARY FORMATS

The binary data files provided on this volume are tables and images.
As described in the labels, most binary files consist of one- and
two-byte integers. For two-byte integers, the least significant byte
appears first, followed by the most significant byte with (optional)
sign. Users of PCs and Digital workstations will find that these files
are in the native machine format. For users of Macintoshes and
workstations from Sun and Silicon Graphics, binary numbers read from
these files will need to be byte-swapped first. However, note that the
software tools included in the SOFTWARE/PROFILE subdirectory take care
of this conversion automatically.

Some binary files in the SORCDATA and FOVMAPS subdirectories contain
four-byte (single precision) floating-point numbers in Vax format.
This is indicated in the label by DATA_TYPE = VAX_REAL or SAMPLE_TYPE
= VAX_REAL. These are unsupported source data files as provided by
the original investigators; the same data can be found in integer form
in the RAWDATA and EDITDATA subdirectories. However, if a user wishes
to interpret these files, the Vax binary data format (and also every
other binary format supported by the PDS) is documented in complete
detail in Appendix C of the PDS Standards Reference (JPL D-7669, Part
2), which is available online at
        //pds.jpl.nasa.gov/stdref/

The SPICE subdirectory contains ephemeris files for Voyager 2 and
planets and satellites, plus the Sun, Earth, and Moon. These files are
provided in SPICE format for a variety of platforms. For more
information about SPICE data and toolkits, consult the PDS Navigation
and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node at
        //pds.jpl.nasa.gov/naif.html

4. VOLUME CONTENTS

4.1 FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

ISO-9660 Level 1 standards require that file names be a maximum of
eight characters. Most of the supported data files provided on this
volume are based on the following nomenclature:

Characters 1-3: Experiment indicator
    1st character: P for PPS.
    2nd character: S for Saturn; U for Uranus; N for Neptune.
    3rd character: 1-8, indicating a stellar occultation sequence
                   number at the given planet.

    Based on these rules, the following indicators have been used:
    PS1   = Saturn delta Sco ring occultation data.
    PS2   = Extended Saturn delta Sco occultation data.
    PS3-8 = Star calibration observations (no rings).
    PU1   = Uranus sigma Sgr ring occultation data.
    PU2   = Uranus beta Per ring occultation data.
    PU3-6 = Star calibration observations associated with Uranus (no
            rings).
    PN1   = Neptune sigma Sgr ring occultation data.

Character 4: File type
    C = calibration models.
    D = edited data.
    G = geometry files.
    J = jitter (instrument pointing) files.
    N = noise data.
    P = resampled, calibrated profiles.
    R = raw data.
    T = trajectory files.
    V = vector files.

Characters 5-6: Version number
    A two-digit number indicating the version number of the given file
    (using a leading zero if necessary). In general, the meaning of
    this number depends on the experiment and file type.

    Note that the vector files are exceptional in that the fifth
    character specifies the coordinate system for the vectors. This
    leaves only the sixth digit to use as a version number.

Characters 7-8: Supplemental
    These characters are only used when needed to further identify a
    file. They are used to distinguish rings, ingress vs. egress,
    coordinate frames, etc. These characters are explained in the
    *INFO.TXT file in each relevant subdirectory.

These naming rules apply to the files in the CALIB, EASYDATA,
EDITDATA, GEOMETRY, JITTER, NOISDATA, RAWDATA, TRAJECT and VECTORS
directories. Non-data files (in the CATALOG, DOCUMENT, INDEX and
SOFTWARE directories) do not follow these conventions. Also, some
ancillary files (FOVMAPS, IMAGES, and SPICE) do not. Finally, the
source data files provided by other investigators (SORCDATA directory)
have been archived under their original names wherever possible.

  | |-PxxVCn*.TAB       Vectors in B1950 celestial coordinates.
  | |
  | |-PxxVEn*.TAB       Vectors in planet equator coordinates, where
  | |                   the Z-axis points along the planet's pole.
  | |                   The longitude reference is Earth's B1950
  | |                   equator.
  | |
  | |-PUxVRn*.TAB       Vectors in ring plane coordinates, where the
  | |                   Z-axis points normal to the ring plane. The

  | |                   Provided for Uranus only.
  |
  |-J2000/*.TAB         A subdirectory containing vector tables based
  |                     on the J2000 coordinate frame. File names are
  |                     identical to those found in the B1950
  |                     subdirectory.
  |
  |-RINGANOM/           A subdirectory containing vector tables in
    |                   ring anomaly coordinates.
    |
    |-PUxVAn*.TAB       Vectors in ring anomaly coordinates, where the
                        Z-axis points normal to the ring plane and the
                        longitude reference is the ring's pericenter.
                        Provided for Uranus only.
