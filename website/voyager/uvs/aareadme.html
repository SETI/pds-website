                VOYAGER 2 UVS RING OCCULTATION ARCHIVE
                --------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

This volume contains the data from the four Voyager 2 Ultraviolet
Spectrometer (UVS) ring occultation experiments: delta Sco at Saturn,
sigma Sgr at Uranus, beta Per at Uranus, and sigma Sgr at Neptune. The
data from each experiment is provided in a variety of formats ranging
from raw to calibrated and resampled. Also provided are ancillary
files containing geometry, calibration models, and trajectory data,
plus software tools for manipulating the data.

For more detailed information and guidance about how to work with this
data set, see the file DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT. Most users will find the
calibrated, uniformly-sampled ring profiles in the EASYDATA directory
tree sufficient for their needs. Users wishing to dig further into the
details of the UVS experiment will probably need only consult the
EDITDATA, GEOMETRY and CALIB directories. Most other files in this
archive are provided primarily for documentation purposes and for
users with very special needs.

This data set represents the second component of a data set collection
which also includes the Voyager Photopolarimeter (PPS) and processed
Radio Science (RSS) ring occultation data sets.

Supporting documentation and label files conform to the Planetary Data
System (PDS) Standards, Version 3.5, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
document JPL D-7669 (October 15, 2002).

2. VOLUME FORMAT

This disk has been formatted according to the ISO 9660 Level 1
Interchange Standard. This format is compatible with a large variety
of computer systems (e.g. Sun, HP, Macintosh, PC). For further
information, refer to the ISO 9660 Standard Document, RF# ISO
9660-1988, 15 April 1988.

3. FILE FORMATS

3.1 FILE EXTENSIONS

Files on this volume are named according to PDS standards, where the
1-3 characters after the period indicate the file type. The file types
used on this volume are:

Binary files:
    Images                                  *.IMG
    Other binary data files                 *.DAT
    SPICE ephemeris files                   *.BSP

    Adobe Acrobat documentation files       *.PDF
    Adobe Postscript documentation files    *.PS

ASCII text files:
    PDS labels                              *.LBL
    ASCII tables and indices                *.TAB

    SPICE transfer ephemeris files          *.XSP
    Other files (for documentation only)    *.FDS, *.FIT, *.LOG, *.OUT

3.2 PDS LABELS

Every file in this data set is described by an associated PDS label.
Most files are described by a detached label, which has the same name
as the corresponding file but an extension ".LBL". Text files (*.TXT,
*.CAT) have attached labels.

In some cases, all or most of the files in a given directory share a
single, abbreviated "combined-detached" label. In this case, the name
of the file is the name of the enclosing directory, with extension
".LBL".

See the PDS Standards Reference (JPL D-7669) for a complete
description of the PDS label format. This document can also be found
online at
        //pds.jpl.nasa.gov/stdref/

3.3 ASCII TEXT FILES

Different popular operating systems use different standards for how
ASCII text files are formatted. On Unix systems, lines are terminated
by a &gt;LF&lt; (linefeed character, control-J, ASCII 10). On Macintosh
computers, lines are terminated by a &gt;CR&lt; (carriage return character,
control-M, ASCII 13). On PCs, lines are terminated by a &gt;CR&lt;&gt;LF&lt; pair.
PDS standards require all text files to use &gt;CR&lt;&gt;LF&lt; line termination.
If the PDS label indicates INTERCHANGE_FORMAT = ASCII or RECORD_TYPE =
STREAM, then this line termination is in use.

On occasion, users on Unix and Macintosh computers may need to change
the line termination on some text files before they can use them. This
can be handled via text editors or a variety of utilities. For
example, the Unix tr (translate) command can be used to change
carriage returns to blanks:
    tr "\015" " " &gt;oldfile.txt &lt;newfile.txt

Some ASCII tables indicate RECORD_TYPE = FIXED_LENGTH and include an
additional parameter RECORD_BYTES, which indicates the length in bytes
of each record in the file. It should be noted that all ASCII files
still include the &gt;CR&lt;&gt;LF&lt; line terminators, and these two bytes are
included in the byte count. For this reason, it is unwise to convert
the line terminator to a single character (&gt;LF&lt; on Unix or &gt;CR&lt; on
Macintosh) because this can change the number of bytes per record and
invalidate the label. In these situations, it is recommended that the
line terminator be replaced by a space plus &gt;LF&lt; or a space plus &gt;CR&lt;
instead.

3.4 BINARY FORMATS

Binary data file formats differ among hardware platforms. Most binary
files are provided in these formats:

IEEE: For Sun, SGI and Macintosh platforms. Integers appear with most
significant byte first; floating-point numbers appear in IEEE format.

PC: For PC platforms. Integers appear with least significant byte
first; floating-point numbers appear in byte-reversed IEEE format.

Vax: For DEC (now HP) VMS platforms. Integers appear with least
significant byte first; floating-point numbers appear in Vax G format.
Although not widely used today, this is the platform on which most
Voyager data were originally used. Note that, for files containing
nothing but integers, the PC versions of files can be used.

Note that the software tools included in the SOFTWARE/PROFILE
subdirectory take care of all data conversions automatically.

The SPICE subdirectory contains ephemeris files for Voyager 2 and
planets and satellites, plus the Sun, Earth, and Moon. These files are
provided in SPICE format for a variety of platforms. For more
information about SPICE data and toolkits, consult the PDS Navigation
and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node at
        //pds.jpl.nasa.gov/naif.html

4. VOLUME CONTENTS

4.1 FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

ISO-9660 Level 1 standards require that file names be a maximum of
eight characters. Most of the supported data files provided on this
volume are based on the following nomenclature:

Characters 1-3: Experiment indicator
    1st character: U for UVS.
    2nd character: S for Saturn; U for Uranus; N for Neptune.
    3rd character: 1-3, indicating a stellar occultation sequence
                   number at the given planet.

    Based on these rules, the following indicators have been used:
    US1 = Voyager 2 delta Sco egress occultation by Saturn's rings.
    US2 = Voyager 2 delta Sco ingress occultation by Saturn's C Ring.
    US3 = Voyager 1 iota Her occultation by Saturn's C Ring.
    UU1 = Voyager 2 sigma Sgr occultation by Uranus' outer rings.
    UU2 = Voyager 2 beta Per occultation by Uranus' rings.
    UN1 = Voyager 2 sigma Sgr occultation by Neptune's rings.

Character 4: File type
    C = calibration models.
    D = edited data consisting of spectral sums.
    F = filtered, calibrated profiles.
    G = geometry files.
    N = noise data.
    P = resampled, calibrated profiles.
    R = raw data.
    T = trajectory files.
    V = vector geometry files.
    W = edited data consisting of full spectra.

Characters 5-6: Version number
    A two-digit number indicating the version number of the given file
    (using a leading zero if necessary). In general, the meaning of
    this number depends on the experiment and file type.

    As an exception, for vector geometry files, the fifth character
    identifies the coordinate system:
    C = celestial coordinates.
    E = planet equator coordinates.
    R = ring planet coordinates.
    A = ring anomaly coordinates.
    In this case, the sixth character still provides a 1-digit version
    number.

Characters 7-8: Supplemental
    These characters are only used when needed to further identify a
    file. They are used to distinguish rings, ingress vs. egress,
    coordinate frames, binary data formats, etc. These characters are
    explained in the *INFO.TXT file in each relevant subdirectory.

Non-data files do not follow these conventions. Furthermore, source
data files provided by other investigators appear on this volume under
their original names, but abbreviated if necessary to conform to ISO
standards. If a file has been renamed, the DESCRIPTION field in the
label indicates the file's original name.

| |-DATAINFO.TXT        Description of the files in this directory.
| |
| |-UxnTnn*.TAB         ASCII data files that tabulate the trajectory
| |                     of Voyager as a function of UVS spectrum index
| |                     during the given occultation.
| |-UxnTnn*.LBL         Detached PDS labels for the above.
|
|-VECTORS/              A directory containing vector position tables
  |                     from which additional geometry parameters can
  |                     be derived.
  |
  |-DATAINFO.TXT        Description of the files in this directory.
  |
  |-B1950/              A subdirectory containing vector tables based
  | |                   on the B1950 coordinate frame.
  | |
  | |-UxxVCn*.TAB       Vectors in B1950 celestial coordinates.
  | |
  | |-UxxVEn*.TAB       Vectors in planet equator coordinates, where
  | |                   the Z-axis points along the planet's pole.
  | |                   The longitude reference is Earth's B1950
  | |                   equator.
  | |
  | |-UUxVRn*.TAB       Vectors in ring plane coordinates, where the
  |                     Z-axis points normal to the ring plane. The
  |                     longitude reference is Earth's B1950 equator.
  |                     Provided for Uranus only.
  |
  |-J2000/*.TAB         A subdirectory containing vector tables based
  |                     on the J2000 coordinate frame. File names are
  |                     identical to those found in the B1950
  |                     subdirectory.
  |
  |-RINGANOM/           A subdirectory containing vector tables in
    |                   ring anomaly coordinates.
    |
    |-UUxVAn*.TAB       Vectors in ring anomaly coordinates, where the
                        Z-axis points normal to the ring plane and the
                        longitude reference is the ring's pericenter.
