<p> <b>Last updated: 8/1/2016, through Amendment 19.</b> </p>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>

<ul>
 <b><p>Step 1 due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/17/2016</p>
    <p>Step 2 due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2/23/2017</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/24/2017</p>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p> The Solar System Workings (SSW) program is described in Appendix C.3 and
    Amendment 1 of the ROSES 2016 NRA.
    The full document can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the
    <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a>
</p>

<p><b> This is a very wide ranging call. While we provide a brief synopsis here,
proposers must refer to the call for specifics.</b>
</p>

<p> The Solar System Workings program solicits proposals for innovative scientific research related
to understanding the atmospheric, climatological, dynamical, geologic, physical, and chemical
processes occurring within the Solar System. This program is open to investigations relevant to
surfaces and interiors of planetary bodies, planetary atmospheres, rings, orbital dynamics, and
exospheres and magnetospheres. The Solar System Workings program values the potential of
interdisciplinary efforts to solve key scientific questions. The program also values research in
comparative planetology. Research supported by this call may include data synthesis, laboratory
studies that examine physical or chemical properties and processes, studies of sample or analog
materials of other Solar System bodies, field studies of terrestrial analogs of planetary
environments, or theoretical and numerical modeling of physical or chemical processes.
</p>

<p>
This program seeks to understand processes that occur throughout the Solar System, as well as
those specific to individual objects and systems, but inform our understanding of the
fundamental processes at work. A nonexhaustive list of areas of research called for in this
solicitation follows. For conciseness in this list, the term "planetary" refers to Solar System
objects other than the Sun (ranging in size from small objects, like comets and asteroids, through
natural satellites, and up to planets) and structures (such as atmospheres, ionospheres, and ring
systems).
</p>



<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<p>The specific data availability and restrictions given for the 2016 SSW are given in
	 Sections C.3 and C.1 of ROSES 2016:
</p>

<ul>

<p>"Mission Data Analysis. NASA solicits proposals that use, analyze, and/or enhance the scientific
   return of certain planetary missions through its data analysis programs (DAPs), listed below.
   Solar System Workings does not accept proposals that are eligible for submission to a DAP. The
   DAP solicitations should be consulted prior to the submission of any proposal that uses planetary
   mission data."
</p>

<p> "For proposals that contain mission data analysis, planetary
    spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed investigations must
    be available in the Planetary Data System (PDS) or equivalent
    publicly accessible archive at least 30 days prior to the proposal
    submission date." </p>

<p> "Regardless of the archive(s) used, if the data to be analyzed
    have issues that might represent an obstacle to analysis, the
    proposers must demonstrate clearly and satisfactorily how such
    potential difficulties will be overcome." </p>
</ul>

 <p>For volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node which meet the SSW basic
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on
  the Step 2 Proposal due date), see the Data Status tab.
 </p>


<p> The Ring-Moon Systems Node generates HST "volumes" which do not contain data. They point to
    data maintained at STScI. These volumes identify HST data, in the public domain,  which contain observations of one
    or more outer planet system(s) (Jupiter through Pluto), and are used to support our search
    tool, OPUS.
</p>

<h3>Finding SSW Relevant Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> Data at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul>
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>

   <p><a href="https://opus.pds-rings.seti.org/opus/#" target="_blank">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of
   data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Cassini
   CIRS, ISS, UVIS and VIMS data, New Horizons
   Jupiter LORRI data, Galileo SSI data, Voyager ISS data, HST ACS, WFPC2 and WFC3 data.
   The results returned include preview products and tables of metadata.</p>


  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>

  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/link/archives-volumes/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>


    <li><b> Use our Mission Information Pages</b></li>

 <p>Our mission information pages provide overviews of data sets and instruments along with
    links to detailed descriptions of the instruments and to the data
    and to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated browse images and footprint diagrams.</p>

  <ul>

  <p><li><a href="/newhorizons/">New Horizons </a>. Our New Horizon page
     provides access to the full set of LORRI Jupiter data and SPICE files, browse images
     for the LORRI data, and links to the full New Horizons Jupiter data collection at the
     Small Bodies Node.</li>
    </p>

  <p><li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a>Our Galileo page supports the Solid State
    Imager (SSI) and the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).  </li>
    </p>

  <p><li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> Our Voyager pages
   support ISS including new data sets of uncompressed, calibrated
   and geometrically corrected images, IRIS, and occultation data
   from PPS, UVS, and RSS. These pages also provide access to the
   Voyager SPICE kernels generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</li>
  </p>

   <p><li><a href="/hst/">HST. </a>Our HST page describes our HST holdings including
    the volumes in our "HST Observations of the Outer Planets" project which
    provide references to HST observations made with either the ACS,
    WFC3, or WFPC2 that included an outer planet system. The volumes are updated
    periodically. </li>
    </p>


  <p><li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While
   publicly available URPX observations obtained under Planetary
   Astronomy Program are covered by this NRA, we do not currently
   have any such data. If eligible URPX data becomes available at
   the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will
   reflect it. </li>
  </p>

  </ul>

  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
   </p>
 </ul>

<h3>Archive Planning</h3>

 <ul>
 <p>Selected investigations may result in data products that
    are of broad use to the science community, including
    maps, data with improved calibrations, etc. NASA
    strongly encourages that such data products be archived
    in the Planetary Data System (//pds.nasa.gov/), or
    equivalent public archive, by the end of the award
    period. Proposers are advised to read C.1, The Planetary
    Science Division Research Program Overview, for
    information on including an archiving plan in the
    proposal.
 </p>
    <ul>
    	<p>
    		<li>Requirements for depositing derived data products in the Planetary Data System have been revised to require that all products be PDS4 conformant.
        </li>
     </p>
    	<p>
    		<li>On July 26, 2016 a change was made to the wording in section C.1 of ROSES 2016 which affects SSW proposals:
 	"Proposers intending to archive data or products in the PDS must obtain and include confirmation, in the form of a letter of support from the appropriate Discipline Node, that the PDS is willing to accept their submission."
        </li>
     </p>
     <p>
     	<li>Proposals submitted to ROSES-2016 are required to include a data management plan (DMP), unless explicitly noted by the specific program element.
     </li>
  </p>
    <ul>
    	<p>
    		<li>Guidelines for preparing PDS4 compliant submissions to the Planetary Data System are available at <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/pds4/about/portal.shtml"> Archiving under PDS4</a>.
       </li>
      </p>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>
 <p><li>Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at
    the PDS Engineering Node's
 <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml"> ROSES support</a> page.</li>
 </p>

  <li>For PDS wide search, start with the
    <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/tools/data-search/">PDS wide search engine</a>.
    This search capability is limited, but initial results include links to relevant and much more
    powerful discipline node search engines. </li>
</ul>
