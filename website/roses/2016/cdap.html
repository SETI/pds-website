<h2>Cassini Data Analysis Program 2016</h2>

<p> <b>Last updated: 3/15/2016, through Amendment 1.</b> </p>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>
<ul>
 <b><p>Step-1 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4/6/2016</p>
    <p>Step-2 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6/16/2016</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/17/2016</b></p>

</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>The Cassini Data Analysis Program (CDAP) is described in Appendix C.10 of the ROSES 2016 NRA.
</p>
<p>
    The full document, including amendments, can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the
    <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a>
</p>
<p><b>The scope of this Program has been clarified and slightly modified in
ROSES-2016. Proposers are expected to carefully read the solicitation and
should E-mail the program point of contact with any questions sufficiently
ahead of the Step-1 proposal deadline.</b></p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

 <p>
 <p>Spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed work must be available in the Planetary Data
System (PDS) or an equivalent, publicly accessible archive, at least 30 days prior to the full
proposal submission deadline.
 </p>


 <p>For volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node which meet the CDAP basic
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on
  the Step 2 Proposal due date), see the Data Status tab.
 </p>


<h3>Finding Cassini Information and Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> At the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul>
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>

  <p><a href="https://opus.pds-rings.seti.org/opus/#" target="_blank">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified 
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of
   data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Saturn system
   data obtained by Cassini CIRS prior to July 2010, and all Saturn system
   observations currently available in PDS obtained by Cassini ISS, UVIS and
   VIMS, as well as data sets obtained by other missions including Voyager.
   Search results include preview images for all observations.</p>

 <p><b>For Cassini ISS, UVIS, and VIMS, the OPUS search parameters are based on
    enhanced geometric metadata generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node, and include constraints
relating to the surfaces of the planet and satellites as well as to the rings.</b>
     </p>

    <li><b> Use our Cassini Information Pages</b></li>
  <p> Our <a href="/cassini/">Cassini information pages</a> provide:
    <ul>
      <li>tabular links to the data organized by observation date for each instrument,</li>
      <li>links to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated preview images (ISS, UVIS and VIMS) and footprint diagrams (CIRS), </li>
      <li>links to tables of enhanced geometric metadata, </li>
      <li>links to volumes of calibrated ISS images, </li>
      <li>overviews of the CIRS, ISS, UVIS, and VIMS instruments and their associated documentation.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>

  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/link/archives-volumes/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>

  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
  </p>
</ul>
</ul>


<h3>Archive Planning</h3>

 <ul>

 <p>Proposed data products for delivery to the PDS should be
    clearly described, and the proposer should consult with
    the manager of the appropriate PDS data node to insure
    that they will be PDS compliant and constructed as
    efficiently as possible.
 </p>
    <ul><li><p>Requirements for depositing derived data products in the Planetary Data System have
        been revised to require that all products be PDS4 conformant. Guidelines for planning
        data in this format are available at
        <a href = "//pds.nasa.gov/pds4"> Archiving under PDS4</a>.
    </p></li>
