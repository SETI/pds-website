<b>Last updated: 6/17/2020, based on the 6/16/2020 Amendment 35 to ROSES 2020.</b>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>

 <b><p>Step-1 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;09/03/2020</p>
    <p>Step-2 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;011/05/2020</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/06/2020</b> </p>

</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>
	The New Frontiers Data Analysis Program (NFDAP) is described in ROSES 2020, Appendix C.7.
</p>

<p>
  See the <a href="https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020" target="_blank">NSPIRES website.</a>  
</p>

<p>
	The objective of the New Frontiers Data Analysis Program (NFDAP) is to enhance the scientific return of 
	New Frontiers Program missions by broadening the scientific participation in the analysis of data collected 
	by New Frontiers missions through projects of relevance to the Planetary Science Division.
</p>

<p>New Horizons mission data is suitable for this Program Element.
</p>

 <p>In order to determine which volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node meet the NFDAP basic 
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on 
  the Step 2 Proposal due date), see the Data Status tab.
 </p>

<p>While all of the New Horizons data are available from the <a href="//pds-smallbodies.astro.umd.edu/data_sb/missions/newhorizons/index.shtml" target="_blank">PDS Small Bodies
Node (SBN)</a>, the Ring-Moon Systems Node
Node maintains duplicate copies of all of the released LORRI and MVIC data. 

 <ul><li>Searches of both LORRI and MVIC data are supported in <a href="/search#/missionid=New+Horizons&view=search&browse=gallery&colls_browse=gallery&page=1&gallery_data_viewer=true&limit=100&order=time1&cols=ringobsid,planet,target,phase1,phase2,time1,time2&widgets=missionid,instrumentid,planet,target&widgets2=&detail=">OPUS</a>.
</li>
  
     <p><li>The Ring-Moon Systems Node has generated preview products for both LORRI and MVIC and tables of enhanced geometric 
     	   metadata for all calibrated LORRI volumes. We will generate geometric metadata for MVIC at some point in the future. 
         All of these products are available via our <a href="/newhorizons/index.html">New Horizons pages</a>. 
    </p></li>
</ul>    
</p>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

   <p><li>For more information about proposing with respect to PDS archiving, see the PDS Engineering Node's <a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/home/proposers/ " target="_blank">Information for Proposers</a> page.</li></p> 

   <p><li>From that page, follow the link to the Proposers to Individual R&A Programs page which contains links to several additional 
     resources including one to the Proposer's Archiving Guide, written specifically to support DAP proposers, and links to ROSES 
     support pages at the individual nodes.</li></p>                                                    

   <li><b>The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</li></b>

  <p><li>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/"  target="_blank">NAIF web site</a>. SPICE 
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data 
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based 
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of 
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users 
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE 
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
