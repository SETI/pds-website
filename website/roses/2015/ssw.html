</ul>

<p>* For SSW, as part of the Step-1 review process all proposals will be directed to
            one of two Step-2 deadlines.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p> The Solar System Workings (SSW) program is described in Appendix C.3 and
    Amendment 1 of the ROSES 2015 NRA.
    The full document can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the
    <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a>
</p>

<p><b> This is a very wide ranging call. While we provide a brief synopsis here,
proposers must refer to the call for specifics.</b>
</p>

<p> The Solar System Workings program element supports research into
    atmospheric, climatological, dynamical, geologic, geophysical, and
    geochemical processes occurring on planetary bodies, satellites,
    and other minor bodies (including rings) in the Solar System. This
    call seeks to address the physical and chemical processes that
    affect the surfaces, interiors, atmospheres, exospheres, and
    magnetospheres of planetary bodies. A wide range of investigations
    will be covered, including theoretical studies, analytical and
    numerical modeling, sample-based studies of extraterrestrial
    materials, field work, laboratory studies, and data synthesis
    relevant to the physical and chemical processes affecting
    planetary systems.
</p>


<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<p>The specific data availability restrictions given for
    the 2015 SSW are given in Section C.1 of ROSES:
</p>

<ul>

<p> "For proposals that contain mission data analysis, planetary
    spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed investigations must
    be available in the Planetary Data System (PDS) or equivalent
    publicly accessible archive at least 30 days prior to the proposal
    submission date." </p>

<p> "Regardless of the archive(s) used, if the data to be analyzed
    have issues that might represent an obstacle to analysis, the
    proposers must demonstrate clearly and satisfactorily how such
    potential difficulties will be overcome." </p>
</ul>

<p> <b>Volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node as of 3/1/2015</b> which meet the
  SSW basic eligibility requirements for publicly available timing and
  PDS certification are listed below. </p>
 <ul>
    <li>ASTROM_nnnn</li>
    <li>EBROCC_0001</li>
    <li>GO_0017 through 0023</li>
    <li>NHJULO_1001 through NHJULO_2003</li>
    <li>NHSP_1000</li>
    <li>RPX_0001 through RPX_0401</li>
    <li>VG_0001 through VG_0038</li>
    <li>VG_2001</li>
    <li>VG_2801, VG_2802, VG_2810</li>
    <li>VGISS_5101 through VGISS_8210</li>
 </ul>

<p>In addition, the following Volumes <b>at the Ring-Moon Systems Node</b> meet the SSW
  basic eligibility requirements for publicly available timing, but <b>are not
  yet certified by PDS</b>. However,
  for some proposals it may be possible to demonstrate that the "...data has
  sufficient quality and is available in sufficient quantity to achieve the
  goals set forth in the proposal."
</p>
<p> Proposers considering using any of the following should
      <a href="/cgi-bin/comments/form.pl?"> contact us</a> early to discuss the
      suitability of specific volumes for their planned research.
</p>

 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>RES_0001</li>
  <li>VG_2803</li>
  <li>VGIRIS_0001 through 0002</li>
 </ul>

<p> Finally, the Ring-Moon Systems Node generates HST "volumes" which do not contain data. They point to
    data maintained at STScI. These volumes identify HST data, in the public domain,  which contain observations of one
    or more outer planet system(s) (Jupiter through Pluto), and are used to support our search
    tool, OPUS. Since the data are maintained at STScI, PDS certification is not relevant.
</p>
 <ul>
  <li>HSTI1_1556 through HSTI1_3067</li>
  <li>HSTJ0_9296 through HSTJ1_2660</li>
  <li>HSTU0_5167 through HSTU1_1956</li>
</ul>

<h3>Finding SSW Relevant Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> Data at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul>
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>

   <p><a href="https://opus.pds-rings.seti.org/opus/#" target="_blank">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified 
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of
   data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Cassini
   CIRS, ISS, UVIS and VIMS data, New Horizons
   Jupiter LORRI data, Galileo SSI data, and Voyager ISS data.
   The results returned include preview products and tables of metadata.</p>


  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>

  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/link/archives-volumes/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>


    <li><b> Use our Mission Information Pages</b></li>

 <p>Our mission information pages provide overviews of data sets and instruments along with
    links to detailed descriptions of the instruments and to the data
    and to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated browse images and footprint diagrams.</p>

  <ul>

  <p><li><a href="/newhorizons/">New Horizons </a>. Our New Horizon page
     provides access to the full set of LORRI Jupiter data and SPICE files, browse images
     for the LORRI data, and links to the full New Horizons Jupiter data collection at the
     Small Bodies Node.</li>
    </p>

  <p><li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a>Our Galileo page supports the Solid State
    Imager (SSI) and the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).  </li>
    </p>

  <p><li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> Our Voyager pages
   support ISS including new data sets of uncompressed, calibrated
   and geometrically corrected images, IRIS, and occultation data
   from PPS, UVS, and RSS. These pages also provide access to the
   Voyager SPICE kernels generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</li>
  </p>

   <p><li><a href="/hst/">HST. </a>Our HST page describes our HST holdings including
    the volumes in our "HST Observations of the Outer Planets" project which
    provide references to HST observations made with either the ACS,
    WFC3, or WFPC2 that included an outer planet system. The volumes are updated
    periodically and currently are complete through observations made during
    the summer of 2012. </li>
    </p>


  <p><li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While
   publicly available URPX observations obtained under Planetary
   Astronomy Program are covered by this NRA, we do not currently
   have any such data. If eligible URPX data becomes available at
   the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will
   reflect it. </li>
  </p>

  </ul>

  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
   </p>
 </ul>

<h3>Archive Planning</h3>

 <ul>
 <p>Selected investigations may result in data products that
    are of broad use to the science community, including
    maps, data with improved calibrations, etc. NASA
    strongly encourages that such data products be archived
    in the Planetary Data System (//pds.nasa.gov/), or
    equivalent public archive, by the end of the award
    period. Proposers are advised to read C.1, The Planetary
    Science Division Research Program Overview, for
    information on including an archiving plan in the
    proposal.
 </p>
    <ul><p><li>Requirements for depositing derived data products in the Planetary Data System have
        been revised to require that all products be PDS4 conformant. Guidelines for planning
    <p><li>Proposals submitted to ROSES-2015 are required to include a data management plan (DMP),
         unless explicitly noted by the specific program element.
     </li>
  </p>
    <ul><p><li>Guidelines for preparing PDS4 compliant submissions to the Planetary Data System are
        available at <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/pds4/about/portal.shtml"> Archiving under PDS4</a>.
       </li>
      </p>
</ul>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>
 <p><li>Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at
    the PDS Engineering Node's
 <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml"> ROSES support</a> page.</li>
 </p>

  <li>For PDS wide search, start with the
    <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/tools/data-search/">PDS wide search engine</a>.
    This search capability is limited, but initial results include links to relevant and much more
    powerful discipline node search engines. </li>
</ul>
