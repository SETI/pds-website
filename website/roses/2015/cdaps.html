<h2>Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientists 2015</h2>

<p> <b>Last updated: 7/1/2015, through Amendment 12</b> </p>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>
<ul>
 <b><p>Step-1 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6/1/2015</p>
    <p>Step-2 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8/18/2015</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7/17/2015</b> </p>

</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>The Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientists Program (CDAPS)
     is described in Appendix C.10 of the ROSES 2015 NRA, and amendment 12 <b>which introduced major
     changes to the final year of the Cassini Participating Scientist program.</b> Due to the significant changes
     in the Participating Scientist portion of this program element embodied in Amendament 12, the
     solicitation has been restructured and the prior version of the text has been replaced in its entirety.
     However due dates have not changed.
</p>
<p>
    The full document, including amendments, can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the
    <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a>
</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

 <p>
 <p>The specific data restrictions given for the 2015
    CDAPS are:
 </p>

  <ul>

  <p>Proposals should be focused on the Saturn system and make
    significant use of (or greatly enhance the use of) data
    returned by Cassini instruments. Additionally, data from
    the Cassini Jupiter flyby in 2000 is eligible. Proposals
    to work with Cassini data and also use ground-based or
    other data are acceptable, provided that the success of
    the proposal, as written, is dependent upon the Cassini data.
  </p>

   <p>In order to be considered, data analysis proposals must use
    data that are in the public domain 30 days before the CDAPS
    Step-2 proposal due date, and they must make clear to the
    peer reviewers that the data are publicly available. Proposals
    that do not comply with this rule may be declared noncompliant
    and declined without evaluation. It is understood, however,
    that once the grant is awarded, succeeding years of work may
    address data that have subsequently come into the archive.
   </p>

   <p>Whether from the PDS or another source, if the data to be
    analyzed is not certified or otherwise has issues that might
    represent an obstacle to analysis, the proposers must clearly
    demonstrate that such potential difficulties can be overcome.
   </p>
  </ul>

 <p><b>Volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node as of 7/1/2015</b> which meet the CDAPS basic
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on
  the Step 2 Proposal due date)and PDS certification are listed
  below. Note - this page will be updated as new data become available.
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>COCIRS_0010 through COCIRS_0306</li>
   <li>COCIRS_0401 through COCIRS_1409*</li>
   <li>COCIRS_5401 through COCIRS_6006</li>
   <li>COISS_0001 through COISS_0011</li>
   <li>COISS_1001 through COISS_1009</li>
   <li>COISS_2001 through COISS_2092</li>
   <li>COISS_3001 through COISS_3007</li>
     <li>CORSS_8001</li>
   <li>COUVIS_0001 through COUVIS_0048</li>
     <li>COUVIS_8001</li>
   <li>COVIMS_0001 through COVIMS_0070</li>
     <li>COVIMS_8001</li>
 </ul>
<p>* <b>In January 2015, the entire set of CIRS data from the Saturn encounter (COCIRS_0401 and later) was
    redelivered to PDS. The new version includes signifcant additions in the form of
    highly derived data in the DATA/CUBES portion of the individual volumes. As of this
    date that portion of each volume has not completed peer review and is not PDS
    certified.</b></p>


<h3>Finding Cassini Information and Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> At the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul>
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>

  <p> <a href="https://opus.pds-rings.seti.org/opus/#" target="_blank">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified 
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of
   data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Saturn system
   data obtained by Cassini CIRS prior to July 2010, and all Saturn system
   observations currently available in PDS obtained by Cassini ISS, UVIS and
   VIMS, as well as data sets obtained by other missions including Voyager.
   Search results include preview images for all observations.</p>

 <p><b>For Cassini ISS, UVIS, and VIMS, the OPUS search parameters are based on
    enhanced geometric metadata generated at the rings node and include constraints
relating to the surfaces of the planet and satellites as well as to the rings.</b>
     </p>

    <li><b> Use our Cassini Information Pages</b></li>
  <p> Our <a href="/cassini/">Cassini information pages</a> provide:
    <ul>
      <li>tabular links to the data organized by observation date for each instrument,</li>
      <li>links to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated preview images (ISS, UVIS and VIMS) and footprint diagrams (CIRS), </li>
      <li>links to tables of enhanced geometric metadata, </li>
      <li>links to volumes of calibrated ISS images, </li>
      <li>overviews of the CIRS, ISS, UVIS, and VIMS instruments and their associated documentation.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>

  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/link/archives-volumes/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>

  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
  </p>
</ul>
</ul>


<h3>Archive Planning</h3>

 <ul>

 <p>Proposed data products for delivery to the PDS should be
    clearly described, and the proposer should consult with
    the manager of the appropriate PDS data node to insure
    that they will be PDS compliant and constructed as
    efficiently as possible.
 </p>
    <ul><li><p>Requirements for depositing derived data products in the Planetary Data System have
        been revised to require that all products be PDS4 conformant. Guidelines for planning
        data in this format are available at
        <a href = "//pds.nasa.gov/pds4"> Archiving under PDS4</a>.
    </p></li>
