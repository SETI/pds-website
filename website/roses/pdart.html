<h2>Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools 2019</h2>

<b>Last updated: 3/22/2019, based on the 3/14/2019 initial release of ROSES 2019.</b>

<ul>
 <b><p>Step-1 proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/9/2019</p>
    <p>Step-2 proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8/1/2019</p>

</p>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><b> We provide a brief synopsis here; proposers must refer to the call 
    for specifics.</b>
</p>

<p> The Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools (PDART) 
    program is described in Appendix C.4. 
See the <a href="https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019" target="_blank">NSPIRES website.</a> 
</p>

<p> The Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration and Tools (PDART) 
    solicits proposals to generate higher-order data products, archive 
    and restore data sets or products, create or consolidate reference 
    databases, digitize data, and develop or validate software 
    tools. 
</p>

<p> For all types of proposals, it is expected that the products of 
    selected proposals will be made available to the scientific 
    community via the NASA PDS or equivalent archive. All proposals 
    will be evaluated on the perceived impact of the new data products 
    or tools on future planetary science research and exploration.
</p>



 
<h3>Archive Planning</h3>

 <ul>
    <p><li>Proposals submitted to ROSES-2019 are required to include a data management plan (DMP).
         However, unlike for other programs, proposers to this program element will not provide a data 
         management plan via the NSPIRES cover pages. Instead, that requirement is superseded by instructions 
         in Appendix C.4 that place more detailed descriptions into the body of the 
         Scientific/Technical/Management section of proposals.
     </li></p>
    	
</ul>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>
	
   <p><li>For more information about proposing with respect to PDS archiving, see the PDS Engineering Node's <a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/home/proposers/ " target="_blank">Information for Proposers</a> page.</li></p> 

   <p><li>From that page, follow the link to the Proposers to Individual R&A Programs page which contains links to several additional 
     resources including one to the Proposer's Archiving Guide, written specifically to support DAP proposers, and links to ROSES 
     support pages at the individual nodes.</li></p>                                                    

   <li><b>The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</li></b>

  <p><li>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/"  target="_blank">NAIF web site</a>. SPICE 
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data 
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based 
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of 
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users 
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE 
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
