<h2> Solar System Workings 2020</h2>

<b>Last updated: 2/25/2020, based on the 2/24/2020 Amendment 2 to ROSES 2020.</b>

<h3> Critical Dates</h3>

<ul>
 <b><p>NOI due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/13/2020</p>
    <p>Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01/09/2021</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12/10/2020</p>
</b></ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p> The Solar System Workings (SSW) program is described in Appendix C.3 of the ROSES 2020 NRA.
    See the <a href="https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020" target="_blank">NSPIRES website.</a>
</p>

<p><b> This is a very wide ranging call. While we provide a brief synopsis here,
proposers must refer to the call for specifics.</b>
</p>

<p> "The Solar System Workings (SSW) program element supports research into atmospheric,
	  climatological, dynamical, geologic, geophysical, and geochemical processes occurring
	  on planetary bodies, satellites, and other minor bodies (including rings) in the Solar
	  System. This call seeks to address the physical and chemical processes that affect
	  the surfaces, interiors, atmospheres, exospheres, and magnetospheres of planetary bodies."
</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<p>The specific data availability and restrictions given for the 2020 SSW are given in
	 Sections C.3 and C.1 of ROSES 2020.

 <p>In order to determine which volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node meet the SSW basic
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on
  the Step 2 Proposal due date), see the Data Status tab.
 </p>

<h3>Finding SSW Relevant Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> Data at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul>
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>

   <p>our Outer Planets Unified Search tool <a href="https://opus.pds-rings.seti.org/opus/#" target="_blank">OPUS</a>, allows users to search for and obtain
   subsets of data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Cassini
   CIRS, ISS, UVIS and VIMS data, New Horizons LORRI and MVIC data, Galileo SSI data, Voyager ISS data,
   HST ACS, NICMOS, STIS, WFPC2 and WFC3 data.

   The results returned include preview products and tables of metadata.</p>

  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>

  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/link/archives-volumes/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>


    <li><b> Use our Mission Information Pages</b></li>

 <p>Our mission information pages provide overviews of data sets and instruments along with
    links to detailed descriptions of the instruments and to the data
    and to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated browse images and footprint diagrams.</p>

  <ul>

  <p><li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a>Our Galileo page supports the Solid State
    Imager (SSI) and the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).  </li>
    </p>

  <p><li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> Our Voyager pages
   support ISS including new data sets of uncompressed, calibrated
   and geometrically corrected images, IRIS, and occultation data
   from PPS, UVS, and RSS. These pages also provide access to the
   Voyager SPICE kernels generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</li>
  </p>

   <p><li><a href="/hst/">HST. </a>Our HST page describes our HST holdings including
    the volumes in our "HST Observations of the Outer Planets" project which
    provide references to HST observations made with the ACS, NICMOS, STIS,
    WFPC2, or WFC3  that included an outer planet system. The volumes are updated
    periodically. </li>
    </p>


  <p><li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While
   publicly available URPX observations obtained under Planetary
   Astronomy Program are covered by this NRA, we do not currently
   have any such data. If eligible URPX data becomes available at
   the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will
   reflect it. </li>
  </p>

  </ul>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>

   <p><li>For more information about proposing with respect to PDS archiving, see the PDS Engineering Node's <a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/home/proposers/ " target="_blank">Information for Proposers</a> page.</li></p>

   <p><li>From that page, follow the link to the Proposers to Individual R&A Programs page which contains links to several additional
     resources including one to the Proposer's Archiving Guide, written specifically to support DAP proposers, and links to ROSES
     support pages at the individual nodes.</li></p>

   <li><b>The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</li></b>

  <p><li>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/"  target="_blank">NAIF web site</a>. SPICE
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
