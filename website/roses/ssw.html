<h2>Solar System Workings 2018</h2>

<p> <b>Last updated: 2/4/2019, through Amendment 59.</b></p>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>

<ul>
 <b><p>NOI due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/15/2018</p>
    <p>Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4/2/2019</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3/2/2019</p>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p> The Solar System Workings (SSW) program is described in Appendix C.3 of the ROSES 2018 NRA. 
    See the <a href="http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2018" target="_blank">NSPIRES website.</a> 
</p>

<p><b> This is a very wide ranging call. While we provide a brief synopsis here, 
proposers must refer to the call for specifics.</b>
</p>

<p> The Solar System Workings program solicits proposals for innovative scientific research related
to understanding the atmospheric, climatological, dynamical, geologic, physical, and chemical
processes occurring within the Solar System. This program is open to investigations relevant to
surfaces and interiors of planetary bodies, planetary atmospheres, rings, orbital dynamics, and
exospheres and magnetospheres. The Solar System Workings program values the potential of
interdisciplinary efforts to solve key scientific questions. The program also values research in
comparative planetology. Research supported by this call may include data synthesis, laboratory
studies that examine physical or chemical properties and processes, studies of sample or analog
materials of other Solar System bodies, field studies of terrestrial analogs of planetary
environments, or theoretical and numerical modeling of physical or chemical processes.
</p>

<p>
This program seeks to understand processes that occur throughout the Solar System, as well as
those specific to individual objects and systems, but inform our understanding of the
fundamental processes at work. A nonexhaustive list of areas of research called for in this
solicitation follows. For conciseness in this list, the term "planetary" refers to Solar System
objects other than the Sun (ranging in size from small objects, like comets and asteroids, through
natural satellites, and up to planets) and structures (such as atmospheres, ionospheres, and ring
systems).
</p>



<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<p>The specific data availability and restrictions given for the 2018 SSW are given in 
	 Sections C.3 and C.1 of ROSES 2018:
</p>


 <p>For volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node which meet the SSW basic 
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on 
  the Step 2 Proposal due date), see the Data Status tab.
 </p>


<p> The Ring-Moon Systems Node generates HST "volumes" which do not contain data. They point to 
    data maintained at STScI. These volumes identify HST data, in the public domain,  which contain observations of one 
    or more outer planet system(s) (Jupiter through Pluto), and are used to support our search 
    tool, OPUS.  
</p>

<h3>Finding SSW Relevant Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> Data at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul> 
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>
    
   <p>our Outer Planets Unified Search tool <a href="/search/">OPUS</a>, allows users to search for and obtain 
   subsets of data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Cassini 
   CIRS, ISS, UVIS and VIMS data, New Horizons LORRI and MVIC data, Galileo SSI data, Voyager ISS data, 
   HST ACS, WFPC2 and WFC3 data. 
   
   The results returned include preview products and tables of metadata.</p>


  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>
  
  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/link/archives-volumes/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>

  
    <li><b> Use our Mission Information Pages</b></li>
    
 <p>Our mission information pages provide overviews of data sets and instruments along with 
    links to detailed descriptions of the instruments and to the data 
    and to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated browse images and footprint diagrams.</p>
  
  <ul> 
    
  <p><li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a>Our Galileo page supports the Solid State 
    Imager (SSI) and the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).  </li>
    </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> Our Voyager pages 
   support ISS including new data sets of uncompressed, calibrated 
   and geometrically corrected images, IRIS, and occultation data 
   from PPS, UVS, and RSS. These pages also provide access to the 
   Voyager SPICE kernels generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</li>
  </p>
 
   <p><li><a href="/hst/">HST. </a>Our HST page describes our HST holdings including
    the volumes in our "HST Observations of the Outer Planets" project which 
    provide references to HST observations made with either the ACS, 
    WFC3, or WFPC2 that included an outer planet system. The volumes are updated
    periodically. </li>
    </p>
    
    
  <p><li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While 
   publicly available URPX observations obtained under Planetary 
   Astronomy Program are covered by this NRA, we do not currently 
   have any such data. If eligible URPX data becomes available at 
   the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will 
   reflect it. </li>
  </p>
 
  </ul>

  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE 
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data 
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based 
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of 
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users 
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE 
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
