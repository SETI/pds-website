<h2>Cassini Data Analysis Program 2017</h2>

<p> <b>Last updated: 3/3/2017, through Amendment 2.</b> </p>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>
<ul>
 <b><p>Step-1 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4/6/2017</p>
    <p>Step-2 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6/8/2017</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/9/2017</b></p>

</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>The Cassini Data Analysis Program (CDAP) is described in Appendix C.10 of the ROSES 2017 NRA.
</p>
<p>
    The full document, including amendments, can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the
    <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a>
</p>
<p><b>Proposers are expected to carefully read the solicitation and
should E-mail the program point of contact with any questions sufficiently
ahead of the Step-1 proposal deadline.</b></p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

 <p>
 <p>Spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed work must be available in the Planetary Data
System (PDS) or an equivalent, publicly accessible archive, at least 30 days prior to the full
proposal submission deadline.
 </p>


 <p>For volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node which meet the CDAP basic
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on
  the Step 2 Proposal due date), see the Data Status tab.
 </p>


<h3>Finding Cassini Information and Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> At the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul>
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>

  <p> Searches of Cassini ISS, UVIS and VIMS data are fully supported in <a href="https://opus.pds-rings.seti.org/opus/#" target="_blank">OPUS</a>. CIRS searches are
  	partially supported by OPUS.
  </p>

 <p>For Cassini ISS, UVIS, and VIMS, the OPUS search parameters are based on
    enhanced geometric metadata generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node, and include constraints
relating to the surfaces of the planet and satellites as well as to the rings.
</p>

  <p><b>Our <a href="/cassini/index.html">Cassini information pages</a> provide:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>tabular links to the data organized by observation date for each instrument,</li>
      <li>links to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated preview images (ISS, UVIS and VIMS) and footprint diagrams (CIRS), </li>
      <li>links to tables of enhanced geometric metadata, </li>
      <li>links to volumes of calibrated ISS images, </li>
      <li>overviews of the CIRS, ISS, UVIS, and VIMS instruments and their associated documentation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>

  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/link/archives-volumes/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>
   <p><li>The PDS has prepared a <a href="https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/Individual-Proposers-Archive-Guide-v11.pdf"> Proposer's Archiving Guide</a>,
	        specifically to support DAP proposers.
   </p></li>

   <p><li> For more information about proposing with respect to PDS archiving, see the PDS Engineering Node's <a href="https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/pds4/propose/proposing.shtml">Information for Proposers</a> web page.
   </p></li>

   <p><li>The PDS Engineering Node's <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml">ROSES Support</a> pages provides links to ROSES support pages at
   	other PDS Discipline Nodes</p>

   </li></p>

  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>. SPICE
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
