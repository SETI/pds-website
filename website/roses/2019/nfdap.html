<h2>New Frontiers Data Analysis Program 2019</h2>

<b>Last updated: 3/22/2019, based on the 3/14/2019 initial release of ROSES 2019.</b>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>
<ul><b>
    <p>NOI due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/30/2019</p>
    <p>Step-2 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8/1/2019</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7/2/2019</p>
</b></ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
	The New Frontiers Data Analysis Program (NFDAP) is described in ROSES 2019, Appendix C.7.
</p>

<p>
  See the <a href="//solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019" target="_blank">NSPIRES website.</a>
</p>

<p>
	The objective of the New Frontiers Data Analysis Program (NFDAP) is to enhance the scientific return of
	New Frontiers Program missions by broadening the scientific participation in the analysis of data collected
	by New Frontiers missions through projects of relevance to the Planetary Science Division.
</p>

<p>New Horizons mission data is suitable for this Program Element.
</p>

 <p>In order to determine which volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node meet the NFDAP basic
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on
  the Step 2 Proposal due date), see the Data Status tab.
 </p>

<p>
    While all of the New Horizons data are available from the <a href="//pds-smallbodies.astro.umd.edu/data_sb/missions/newhorizons/index.shtml" target="_blank">PDS Small Bodies
    Node (SBN)</a>, the Ring-Moon Systems Node
    Node maintains duplicate copies of all of the released LORRI and MVIC data.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Searches of both LORRI and MVIC data are supported in <a href="{{ site.opus_url }}/mission=New+Horizons&cols=opusid,instrument,planet,target,time1,observationduration&widgets=mission,instrument,planet,target" target="_blank">OPUS</a>.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>The Ring-Moon Systems Node has generated preview products for both LORRI and MVIC and tables of enhanced geometric
     	   metadata for all calibrated LORRI volumes. We will generate geometric metadata for MVIC at some point in the future.
           All of these products are available via our <a href="/newhorizons/index.html">New Horizons pages</a>.
    </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p>For more information about proposing with respect to PDS archiving, see the PDS Engineering Node's <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/home/proposers/ " target="_blank">Information for Proposers</a> page.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>From that page, follow the link to the Proposers to Individual R&A Programs page which contains links to several additional
            resources including one to the Proposer's Archiving Guide, written specifically to support DAP proposers, and links to ROSES
            support pages at the individual nodes.
    </p></li>
    <li><b>The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

    <li><p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the
       <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/"  target="_blank">NAIF web site</a>. SPICE
       data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data
       necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based
       instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of
       software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users
       incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE
       files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as
       altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
