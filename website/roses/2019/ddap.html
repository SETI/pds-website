<h3>Archiving Considerations</h3>

 <p>
 <p>While no Discovery DAP supported data is archived with the Ring-Moon Systems Node, this node may be a suitable site
 	for archiving data produced as a result of analysis of Kepler/K2 solar system observations. If you think this may be the case for
 	data you intend to produce, early in your proposal development
