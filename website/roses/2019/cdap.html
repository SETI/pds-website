<h2>Cassini Data Analysis Program 2019 (C.10)</h2>
     
<b>Last updated: 3/22/2019, based on the 3/14/2019 initial release of ROSES 2019.</b>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>
<ul>
 <b><p>Step-1 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/16/2019</p>
    <p>Step-2 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7/18/2019</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6/18/2019</b></p>

</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The Cassini Data Analysis Program (CDAP) is described in Appendix C.10 of the ROSES 2019 NRA.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019" target="_blank">NSPIRES website.</a> 
</p>
<p><b>Proposers are expected to carefully read the solicitation and
should E-mail the program point of contact with any questions sufficiently
ahead of the Step-1 proposal deadline.</b></p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

 <p>
 <p>Spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed work must be available in the Planetary Data
System (PDS) or an equivalent, publicly accessible archive, at least 30 days prior to the full
proposal submission deadline. 
 </p> 
 

 <p>In order to determine which volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node meet the CDAP basic 
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on 
  the Step 2 Proposal due date), see the Data Status tab.
 </p>
 
 
<h3>Finding Cassini Information and Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> At the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul>
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>
    
  <p> Searches of Cassini ISS, UVIS and VIMS data are fully supported in <a href="/search/">OPUS</a>. CIRS searches are
    partially supported by OPUS.
  </p>   

 <p>For Cassini ISS, UVIS, and VIMS, the OPUS search parameters are based on 
    enhanced geometric metadata generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node, and include constraints 
relating to the surfaces of the planet and satellites as well as to the rings. 
</p>
      
  <p><b>Our <a href="/cassini/index.html">Cassini information pages</a> provide:</b></p>
    <ul> 
      <li>tabular links to the data organized by observation date for each instrument,</li>
      <li>links to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated preview images (ISS, UVIS and VIMS) and footprint diagrams (CIRS), </li>
      <li>links to tables of enhanced geometric metadata, </li>
      <li>links to volumes of calibrated ISS images, </li>
      <li>overviews of the CIRS, ISS, UVIS, and VIMS instruments and their associated documentation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>
  
  <p><li><b>Downloading</b> entire volumes: select the volume in the data directory, and then click on "Archives for: [ volumes ]" near the top of the page to reach the associated tar.gz file for that volume.</li></p>


</ul>
<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>
	
   <p><li>For more information about proposing with respect to PDS archiving, see the PDS Engineering Node's <a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/home/proposers/ " target="_blank">Information for Proposers</a> page.</li></p> 

   <p><li>From that page, follow the link to the Proposers to Individual R&A Programs page which contains links to several additional 
     resources including one to the Proposer's Archiving Guide, written specifically to support DAP proposers, and links to ROSES 
     support pages at the individual nodes.</li></p>                                                    

   <li><b>The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</li></b>

  <p><li>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/"  target="_blank">NAIF web site</a>. SPICE 
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data 
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based 
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of 
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users 
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE 
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
