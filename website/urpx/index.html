# The 2007-2008 Uranus Ring Plane Crossings

The Sun and Earth pass through Uranus' ring plane in 2007 and 2008, providing
a unique opportunity to observe Uranus' rings and smallest satellites. The
edge-on viewing geometry also permits the timing of satellite eclipses and
mutual events that can be used to improve ephemerides.

## Data Sets

  * The PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node intends to archive as much of the HST and
  highest quality ground based URPX as is made available. Observers interested in
  archiving data should contact [Mark Showalter](//www.seti.org/our-scientists/mark-showalter){:target="_blank"}
  or [Mitch Gordon](//www.seti.org/our-scientists/mitchell-gordon){:target="_blank"}.

  * We will post links to data as it becomes available.

## Tools

  * The [Ring-Moon Systems Node On-Line Tools](/tools/) are available for visualizing the changing geometry and assisting with observation planning.

## Links to external Uranus RPX and Equinox web sites.

  * The International Outer Planet Watch Uranus and Neptune Discipline (www.apl.ucl.ac.uk/iopw/) includes information on the planning for an international campaign of Uranian observations, the report from the 2006 'Uranus at Equinox' Pasadena Workshop, and several additional links.


  * The Institut de Mécanique Céléste et de Calcul des
    Ephémérides (IMCCE, www.imcce.fr/pheura07) web
    site includes detailed information, software tools, and
    predictions of Uranian satellite mutual events as well as
    several additional links.

   * Additional mutual event predictions are available from
