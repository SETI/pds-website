# Welcome to the Ring-Moon Systems Node's Cassini Home Page

## Introduction

The PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node archives and distributes Cassini remote sensing data sets 
(CIRS, ISS, UVIS, VIMS, and Radio Science ring occultations).

  * Use **[OPUS](/search/)**
to search for specific Cassini data products using a wide range of criteria including enhanced geometric metadata produced at the Rings node. The enhanced geometric metadata includes information appropriate to planet and satellite searches as well as enhanced ring geometry.

    * Supports CIRS (limited), ISS, UVIS, and VIMS.

    * Search results include data files, tables of associated metadata, and browse thumbnails for each image. User selected data files can be bundled as [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) files for easy downloading. 

The first Cassini data release was on July 1, 2005 with subsequent data
releases at three month intervals. The last scheduled mission data release was in
early July, 2018.

During FY18, while the team was preparing the data for releases following the spacecraft's
plunge into the atmosphere of Saturn, they, in conjunction with the PDS, also began the 
task of organizing supplemental documentation and in some cases derived products from the mission.

  * The RMS Node will be the curating PDS Node for all such documents and products produced by 
    the Cassini Rings Working Group. 

    * Projected additional datasets include occultation data sets for the entire mission from RSS, UVIS, and VIMS; 
      a data set of ISS mosaics of the F-Ring; separate ISS radial profiles of the bright and faint rings of Saturn; a data set of 
      ISS high resolution rings images with radial structure subtracted; and a data set of VIMS reflectance spectra of the rings.

    * Projected documentation includes substantial sets of observation planning information for all of the rings observations.

    * As each data or document set becomes available we will post information on 
      our home page, in these Cassini information pages, and release announcements through the  
     <strong><a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/top.cfm" target="_blank">PDS Subscription Service</a></strong>,
     and through announcements in PEN.

###  <a name="report">Volume 1</a> of the Cassini Mission Final Report

  * The Cassini mission team made a major effort to summarize the mission in a multi-volume report to NASA. Volume 1 contains the science 
    component: Mission Overview, Science Objectives and Results while technical information is contained in additional volumes 
    archived at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Below are links to the / volume 1 document, and extracted sections relevant to the RMS Node. 
    The / document also is available at the Atmospheres Node's 
     <strong><a href="https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini/Cassini.html" target="_blank">Cassini Archiving</a></strong> web pages.

  * Cassini data is curated at five different PDS Nodes. The lead node for the mission is the 
    Atmospheres Node which maintains an omnibus set of 
    <strong><a href="https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini/Cassini.html" target="_blank">Cassini Archiving</a></strong> 
    web pages. These contain a wealth of supplemental information for understanding Cassini and the observations and are updated as 
    new material becomes available.

    * <strong><a href="master as planned 7-25-17.csv">Master Schedule (updated 7/24/17)</a></strong>. This is an "as-planned" 
      listing of observations spanning the interval from May 14, 2004 to July 9, 2017. The list contains 61,874 entries 
      and may be downloaded and sliced and diced to make your own listing.
