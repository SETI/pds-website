### Cassini ISS

The Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) consists of two cameras, narrow-
angle and wide-angle. Each obtains fine-resolution monochromatic images
between blue and near-infrared wavelengths.

**Cassini ISS Calibration Software Update**.

  * **November 2019.** CISSCAL updated to version 4.1 
  * These updates are contained in the revised [COISS_0011](/link/volumes/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0011/) volume (version 4.3).
  * Download the [.tar.gz bundle](/link/archives-volumes/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0011.tar.gz). 
  * Changes from version 3.9.1 include:
    * Improved logic in option file reader and cisscal_cl.pro
    * Changed formatting of bitweight files to ease parsing
    * Added logic to handle bias/2-hz noise removal for TABLE images of various gain states
    * Improved CISSCAL_Log formatting
    * Updates to polarized filter algorithm in make_polar_image.pro (see make_polar_image_readme.txt)
    * A final polarizer correction.

**Cassini ISS Calibration Software Update**.

  * **October 2018.** CISSCAL updated to version 3.9.1 
  * These updates are contained in the revised [COISS_0011](/link/volumes/COISS_0xxx_v4.1/COISS_0011/) volume (version 4.1).
  * Download the [.tar.gz bundle](/link/archives-volumes/COISS_0xxx_v4.1/COISS_0011.tar.gz). 
  * Changes from version 3.9 include:
    * fixed a broken, rarely used, command line keyword
    * minor edits that do not affect the software execution

**Cassini ISS Data User Guide Update**. 

  * **September 2018.** An updated version of the **<a href="iss_data_user_guide_180916.pdf" target="_blank">ISS User Guide</a>** is available.
  * Changes from previous versions include:
    * Completed the description of how to use CISSCAL making this version, and any subsequent versions, of the ISS User Guide the 
      definitive source for how to use CISSCAL.

**Cassini ISS Calibration Software Update**.

  * **August 2018.** CISSCAL updated to version 3.9. 
  * These updates are contained in the revised [COISS_0011](/link/volumes/COISS_0xxx_v4/COISS_0011/) volume.
  * Download the [.tar.gz bundle](/link/archives-volumes/COISS_0xxx_v4/COISS_0011.tar.gz). 
  * Changes from version 3.8 include:
    * corrections to the flatfielding calibration step for the NAC,
    * completed absolute calibration steps of the ISS cameras,  
    * a correction for sensitivity changes over time.
  * Currently, absolute flux in the NAC and WAC is known to a 1-sigma
    error of about 3-10% depending on filter combination. The final version of
    the calibration, implemented in CISSCAL 3.9, shows good agreement between
    stars and satellite targets. The overall camera sensitivity is seen to decline
    linearly starting in S03 for the NAC and S17 for the WAC, with a total
    decline at the end of the mission of about 8% and 3%, respectively.

**Cassini ISS Calibration Software Update**.

  * **May 2016.** CISSCAL updated to version 3.8 along with updated calibration files and documentation. 
  * These updates are contained in the revised [COISS_0011](/link/volumes/COISS_0xxx_v3/COISS_0011/) volume.
  * Download the [.tar.gz bundle](/link/archives-volumes/COISS_0xxx_v3/COISS_0011.tar.gz). 
  * See [ISS Software](/cassini/iss/software.html) for a summary of the changes.
